# ez-guitar-hero
A web-based rhythm game inspired by Guitar Hero, built with TypeScript, RxJS, and Tone.js. This project uses a reactive approach for its game loop, processing streams of musical notes from CSV files. Players hit notes in time with the music to score points, increase multipliers, and achieve high scores.
